/** Stretches the width of the children to 100% (except images, which would be distorted. They are then centered)
 * This is done because the direct parent of the children of the Row component is flex now, which changes the
 * way children blocks are rendered (children with display: block of non-flex elements have 100% width, and
 * children of flex elements have the minimum possible width in respect of their content).
 * This can be cancelled with the prop `preventHorizontalStretch`
